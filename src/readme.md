## Features

- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  - Track the source Observable and operator name for each notification.
  - Log lifecycle events like `next`, `error`, `complete`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe`.
  - Measure timing metrics to detect delays and bottlenecks.

- **Visualization**:
  - Create visual representations of RxJS pipelines using tools like Mermaid.js.
  - Generate real-time diagrams to monitor data flow and operator behavior.

- **Error Analytics**:
  - Capture detailed error information, including operator and source context.
  - Simulate errors and delays for resilience testing.

- **Educational Utility**:
  - Use the tool to teach RxJS concepts interactively.
  - Provide insights into pipeline transformations, operator usage, and resource management.
